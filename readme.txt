== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= How do I override number of days for the Islamic month? =

You have 2 options, Login to WordPress Admin panel, and from Month Days tab, add month and days entry. 2nd option, you can use a dedicated private page to override.

= How to use the private page to update Islamic month days? =

Create a page with title as Days, add shortcode [xllentech-islamic-days]. You are done. 

I recommend making the page private or password protected to make 2 stage authentication. 1st your password and 2nd authentication is the pin used in the file, it's 1234 by default, Go to Settings to change it to whatever you like.

= I get error "Oops, Looks like First Islamic Date is missing in the database, Plz contact support for guidance.", what do I do? =

Please Login to WordPress Admin panel, Visit Settings->Xllentech Calendar, go to Troubleshooting tab, You will see  table with empty text boxes, Please add current English month number in Month, current English year in Year, Islamic day on the 1st day of current English month in Islamic Day, similarly Islamic month on the 1st day of current English month in Islamic Month and Islamic year on the 1st day of current English month in Islamic Year and Click ADD. Calendar should work fine now.
